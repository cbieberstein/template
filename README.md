# Python Project Template

Very simple setup for Python development (cookiecutter is better but much more complicated).
Make can drive your work, and this integrates beautifully with VS Code.


- Makefile with 
  - .venv creation and requirements installation
  - code formatting, linting, type checking, import sorting
  - Testing with pytest (and a sample test because who remembers syntax)
- .gitignore with the basics
- Directory structure for project
- Dockerfile template for Python 3.10
